I have worked in many different environments covering the majority of the key factors. However, in the last few years one of the areas that I have become more and more interested in is the contribution that play can deliver to the development of children. 

We believe that play stimulates and encourages learning and all aspects of children's development. Through play, children develop language skills, emotions, creativity and social skills. For most children play is natural and spontaneous however children will benefit from encouragement and help from adults. 

Play will take place indoors and outdoors and it is in these different environments that children explore and discover their immediate world. 

Children will use play to experiment with ideas and gain skills; they will find that they are taking risks and their imagination will come to the forefront for solving problems alone or with other children. 

The role of the Early Years Professional in play development is crucial. They provide children with the time and resources to develop their independence. Resources will inspire their imagination such as dressing up clothes, boxes, buckets, old blankets. 
Children may be shy inititaly watching and waiting to be invited into the play -- encouragement from the Early Years Professional is vital. 

The settings and the professional must provide safe but challenging environments that support and extend learning and development. 

My practice with my experience can provide practical and useful guidance on how to achieve the best possible play environment. 

Save The Children states (March 2016) that every nursery in England should have a qualified early years teacher to help toddlers develop skills like speech and language 

From this statement I believe that it is therefore important that staff receive reassurance and support that will give them confidence to achieve this qualification. 

It is also essential to remember that being a good early years practitioner is so much more than just having academic qualifications - experience, a caring disposition and crucially, an in-depth understanding of child development are all vital skills.
My objective is to motivate practitioners and never to undermine or demoralise. All my visits are carried out with the utmost sensitivity and without distracting or disrupting the day to day running of the practice.
As part of my consultancy service I will visit your setting and discreetly observe practice from which I will provide effective and sensitive suggestions for development. For all consultancy visits, I also give verbal feedback to the Manager followed by a fully comprehensive written development plan, that will include clearly agreed targets.
I will visit your school to review your current EYFS provision and to discuss your individual requirements and objectives. This involves spending time observing practice, evaluating the learning environment and analysing assessment evidence and data. If the manager agrees, meeting with staff to discuss their views can also be included.
Together, we will negotiate strategies and agree actions to support you and your staff to develop and improve your EYFS provision that will enable you to achieve your desired outcomes.
